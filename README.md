MOTORCYCLE NUMBER PLATE IDENTIFICATION

In this project i am using yolv5 algorithm to detect rider, licence plate and riders head. Then using resnet50 image classifier, i classify wheather the rider is wearing a helmet or not. If not wearing a helmet then, it will save his licence plate number in a image folder, and also will capture rider image in a separate folder.
